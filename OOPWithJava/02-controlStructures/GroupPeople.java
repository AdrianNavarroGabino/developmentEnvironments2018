/*
Create a program called GroupPeople that asks the user to enter how many
people is going to attend to a conference. The program must create groups of
(preferably) 50 people. Whenever this is not possible, then it will attempt to 
create groups of 10 people, and finally it will create groups of 1 person. 
The program must output how many groups of each category are necessary. For 
instance, if 78 people are going to attend to the conference, then we need 1 
group of 50 people, 2 groups of 10 people and 8 groups of 1 people.
